                <strong>Oxford Tutors NYC</strong> is a tutoring collective dedicated to helping students from preschool through university recognize their unique intelligence and potential. We believe that with the right coaching, all students have within them the
                capacity to succeed academically and to thrive beyond the classroom.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                At the core of our approach is the methodology that Oxford University made famous, the "Oxford tutorial system." This form of hands-on mentorship challenges students to be intellectually rigorous, resourceful, and independent, and to approach their studies

              <p class="">
                A native Southerner, Elisabeth completed her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in English Literature and Language at Oxford University in England.  As the only American undergraduate in her college, Elisabeth was struck by the revolutionary nature of the
                tutorial system, and the way in which methodical questioning might transform the "multiple choice" nature of American education.
              </p>
              <p>
                For more than a dozen years, Elisabeth has been implementing the Oxford tutorial system with students facing challenges in all levels of education, from kindergarten to grad school.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, she focuses her attention on admissions strategy at the high school, college and grad school levels. Joined by her incredibly talented teaching team at Oxford Tutors, Elisabeth delights in helping students recognize that everything they need to
                know is already within them.  </p>
