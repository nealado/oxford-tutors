        "After having questioned several tutoring organizations about their methods and hearing their sales pitches, it was a relief to hear something different from Oxford Tutors NYC: "We need to get to know your child before we can tell you how our sessions
        will work for him." Our tutor insisted on interviewing my son before outlining a schedule and process. Needless to say, our son received individualized instruction tailored to his needs....in his case, this did not involve a large number of sessions,
        but his skills and scores improved dramatically. And he loved the experience. We're confident our son will be applying the skills he learned from Oxford Tutors NYC well past his college entrance tests, on into his life."

        "We have had the pleasure of working with Oxford Tutors NYC for the past six years, as they’ve helped our daughter with learning differences through her high school and college experiences. They have unbounded patience with the perfect amount of accountability
        – very gentle but with firm expectations. They know just how far to push and students work hard to get there. Even though we live in California, our modern technology and Oxford Tutors NYC’s exceptional organizational skills have made working with
        them a reality and it works! Our daughter has grown exponentially academically, personally and socially because of the relationship that she has had with Oxford Tutors NYC over the years." </p> <p class="testimonial_name">Melissa, Mother of Skype/Long Distance Student

        "My son started working with Oxford Tutors NYC in the middle of his Junior year ostensibly for the college admissions process, but he got much more than that out of their methodology. They helped Ben to understand how he learns in general, when to slow
        down and when nerves were getting in the way of trusting himself. They took a lot of the inevitable feeling of pressure out of the whole process for all of us. Oxford Tutors NYC is highly honorable about the whole concept of tutoring--and does not
        schedule weekly meetings for the sake of it. Our tutor made sure that Ben had work to do on his own that was manageable along with his schoolwork and came up with an affordable plan for face-to- face sessions, ensuring that each one was hugely productive.
        Oxford Tutors NYC helped him to achieve the goals he set for himself! I recommended Oxford Tutors NYC to a few friends and everyone is now so grateful to me---as they all say that they helped to make a stressful time have more real purpose; they make
        sure that their work with each student is full of life long lessons." </p> <p class="testimonial_name">Peggy, Mother of SAT/College Prep Student
