      <p>"I got a scholarship to do my ACT prep with Oxford Tutors and the experience changed my life. I was a B student, but I aced the test and then everything changed. Elisabeth and her team mentored me through the college admissions process and I was accepted
        to an Ivy League college. I will never have enough words of thanks for the chance I was given by Oxford Tutors. THANK YOU!" </p> <p class="testimonial_name">--Rizwan, 18</p>

      <p>"They give as much effort as I give, if not more. They don't just tutor you, they teach you. They do more than help me succeed on my next test; they go back and make sure I comprehend the fundamentals so I can understand the material, not just memorize
        it now and forget it later. I just wish they lived right next door-- not only because they are super helpful, but they are also just lovely people. They tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear, with supportive but honest, down-to-earth
        advice. I never feel like I'm asking a stupid question because they are so open and easy to talk to and willing to help me. You'll be happy to see them every time they walk into the room." </p> <p class="testimonial_name">--Eve, 17</p>

      <p>"The tutors at Oxford Tutors NYC are bright, encouraging people who instruct you in a way that you don’t see every day; they incorporate learning and memorization into larger activities, which allows you to truly understand the material. In addition,
        I know that they are tutoring me because they are passionate about knowledge. I know that they genuinely care. They are also delightful and I love having them around. It’s really motivating to be working with such clever and extraordinary people."

      <p>"The tutors at Oxford Tutors NYC are great. My grades have gone up so much since I started meeting with them. And now I take care of my own time and I feel more independent. That's been cool." </p> <p class="testimonial_name">--Antonio, 12</p>
