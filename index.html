              <p>Oxford Tutors NYC is a tutoring collective dedicated to helping students from preschool through university recognize their unique intelligence and potential. We believe that with the right coaching, all students have within them the capacity
                to succeed academically and to thrive beyond the classroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the core of our approach is the methodology that Oxford University made famous, the "Oxford tutorial system." This form of hands-on mentorship challenges students to be intellectually rigorous, resourceful, and independent, and to approach their studies
                with curiosity and confidence.</p>

                      <p> Elisabeth, Founder & Director A native Southerner, Elisabeth completed her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in English Literature and Language at Oxford University in England.  As the only American undergraduate in her college, Elisabeth
                        was struck by the revolutionary nature of the tutorial system, and the way in which methodical questioning might transform the "multiple choice" nature of American education.   For more than a dozen years, Elisabeth has been implementing
                        the Oxford tutorial system with students facing challenges in all levels of education, from kindergarten to grad school.  Today, she focuses her attention on admissions strategy at the high school, college and grad school levels. Joined
                        by her incredibly talented teaching team at Oxford Tutors, Elisabeth delights in helping students recognize that everything they need to know is already within them.  </p>
