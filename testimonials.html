      <h2>WHAT PARENTS ARE SAYING</h2>
    
      <p>
        "After having questioned several tutoring organizations about their methods and hearing their sales pitches, it was a relief to hear something different from Oxford Tutors NYC: "We need to get to know your child before we can tell you how our sessions
        will work for him." Our tutor insisted on interviewing my son before outlining a schedule and process. Needless to say, our son received individualized instruction tailored to his needs....in his case, this did not involve a large number of sessions,
        but his skills and scores improved dramatically. And he loved the experience. We're confident our son will be applying the skills he learned from Oxford Tutors NYC well past his college entrance tests, on into his life."

        "We have had the pleasure of working with Oxford Tutors NYC for the past six years, as they’ve helped our daughter with learning differences through her high school and college experiences. They have unbounded patience with the perfect amount of accountability
        – very gentle but with firm expectations. They know just how far to push and students work hard to get there. Even though we live in California, our modern technology and Oxford Tutors NYC’s exceptional organizational skills have made working with
        them a reality and it works! Our daughter has grown exponentially academically, personally and socially because of the relationship that she has had with Oxford Tutors NYC over the years." </p> <p class="testimonial_name">Melissa, Mother of Skype/Long Distance Student

      <p>
        "My son started working with Oxford Tutors NYC in the middle of his Junior year ostensibly for the college admissions process, but he got much more than that out of their methodology. They helped Ben to understand how he learns in general, when to slow
        down and when nerves were getting in the way of trusting himself. They took a lot of the inevitable feeling of pressure out of the whole process for all of us. Oxford Tutors NYC is highly honorable about the whole concept of tutoring--and does not
        schedule weekly meetings for the sake of it. Our tutor made sure that Ben had work to do on his own that was manageable along with his schoolwork and came up with an affordable plan for face-to- face sessions, ensuring that each one was hugely productive.
        Oxford Tutors NYC helped him to achieve the goals he set for himself! I recommended Oxford Tutors NYC to a few friends and everyone is now so grateful to me---as they all say that they helped to make a stressful time have more real purpose; they make
        sure that their work with each student is full of life long lessons." </p> <p class="testimonial_name">Peggy, Mother of SAT/College Prep Student

      <h2>WHAT EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS SAY</h2>
      <p>“I’m delighted to have Oxford Tutors as a resource. They are a special group of people—kind, committed, thorough, and perceptive. They’re team players, and passionate about what they do. I highly recommend them!” </p> <p class="testimonial_name">-Dr. Larry Hess, Neuropsychologist and
        Learning Evaluator</p>
    
      <p>“Oxford Tutors NYC is a uniquely psychologically-minded mentorship company not afraid to “say how it is.” -Dr. B., Psychologist</p>
    
      <p>“Oxford Tutors does much more than tutor students for exams. They mentor students into the sort of transformation that prepares them for the college journey ahead. In all my years observing tutoring companies from afar, I’ve never seen one like Oxford
        Tutors NYC.”</p> <p class="testimonial_name"> --Tina, College Counselor in NYC Private School</p>
    
      <h2>WHAT STUDENTS SAY</h2>
    
      <p>"I got a scholarship to do my ACT prep with Oxford Tutors and the experience changed my life. I was a B student, but I aced the test and then everything changed. Elisabeth and her team mentored me through the college admissions process and I was accepted
        to an Ivy League college. I will never have enough words of thanks for the chance I was given by Oxford Tutors. THANK YOU!" </p> <p class="testimonial_name">--Rizwan, 18</p>
    
    
      <p>"They give as much effort as I give, if not more. They don't just tutor you, they teach you. They do more than help me succeed on my next test; they go back and make sure I comprehend the fundamentals so I can understand the material, not just memorize
        it now and forget it later. I just wish they lived right next door-- not only because they are super helpful, but they are also just lovely people. They tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear, with supportive but honest, down-to-earth
        advice. I never feel like I'm asking a stupid question because they are so open and easy to talk to and willing to help me. You'll be happy to see them every time they walk into the room." </p> <p class="testimonial_name">--Eve, 17</p>
    
      <p>"The tutors at Oxford Tutors NYC are bright, encouraging people who instruct you in a way that you don’t see every day; they incorporate learning and memorization into larger activities, which allows you to truly understand the material. In addition,
        I know that they are tutoring me because they are passionate about knowledge. I know that they genuinely care. They are also delightful and I love having them around. It’s really motivating to be working with such clever and extraordinary people."
      </p> <p class="testimonial_name">--Ashley, 14</p>
    
      <p>"The tutors at Oxford Tutors NYC are great. My grades have gone up so much since I started meeting with them. And now I take care of my own time and I feel more independent. That's been cool." </p> <p class="testimonial_name">--Antonio, 12</p>
